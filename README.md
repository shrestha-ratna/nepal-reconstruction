# Beyond Reconstruction: What Leads to Satisfaction in Post-Disaster Recovery?

### Abstract
> Many studies have shown that economic and political freedom better predict overall subjective life satisfaction than income or material consumption. However, in the context of post-disaster reconstruction, whether freedom of choice in reconstruction is a better predictor of subjective satisfaction than the extent of material reconstruction is much less clear. In this paper, employing ordinal logistic regression analysis to data collected in the aftermath of Nepal’s 7.8 Mw 2015 earthquake, we find that freedom of choice in the reconstruction process predicts households’ post-disaster subjective happiness better than the extent of physical reconstruction per se. However, too much freedom beyond certain thresholds may decrease happiness. Interestingly, many seemingly important predictors such as income, education, location, occupation and age of respondents that we investigated are not statistically significant. Apart from freedom of choice, only gender and ethnicity display significant effect in explaining happiness. We also find a negative correlation between happiness level and happiness inequality among ethnic groups; the reverse is true in the case of gender. These findings underscore the importance of freedom, and ethnic or gender-specific policies, in promoting well-being in post-disaster recovery.
